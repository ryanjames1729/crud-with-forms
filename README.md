# Using Forms for a CRUD App
As a CS teacher, one of my achievements is to teach students how to manage data correctly using Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. This app is a simple demonstration of how to use CRUD operations in a web application. But, for me as a web developer, these are operations that I set up at the beginning of a project and don't think about again until I need to add a new feature. So, I decided I need to create this sandbox app to play around with these operations so that I can get better at building them in the NextJS 14 App Router wtih GraphQl Queries and Mutations.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
